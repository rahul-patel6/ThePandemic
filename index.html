  <h3>
    This website is about how the Covid Pandemic affected casinos, workers and
    operaters.The covid pandemic has always been a dreadful time for the
    people in Las Vegas. Many citizens lost jobs as service workers, small
    buisness owners, and transportation workers. The casinos lost a lot of
    economy because tourist and citizens of Las Vegas could not come into
    hotel or casinos to gamble. Therefore, less people spent money on
    gambiling and casino's economy went down.

      <h3>
        Restaurants, hotels, and even casinos had to close, in many cases
        laying off their workers. On the Las Vegas Strip, business was closed
        due to a mandate from the state and when it reopened, it was a
        rough year before you could say the city had gotten back to normal.

      <h3>
        The covid pandemic hit some industries harder than others. This is
        because people were spending more money on at-home activities because
        they were forced to, not because they wanted to. That does not mean
        that the pandemic had no lasting effects. It turns out that watching
        most movies at home offers better value in money and creates a more
        pleasant experience than making the trip to a theater.

    <h2 id="fix">How to fix these problems</h2>
    <h3>
      The way we can fix these problems is by getting vacinated. Getting
      vacinated will never allow Covid to happen again. If you are not
      vaccinated because you are a child but everyone around you is, then it
      is likley you will not get covid and it will not spread.
